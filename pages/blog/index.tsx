          Detailed intro to Metaverse:
        </div>
        TO HEAR TECH CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg or Satya Nadella talk about it,
        the metaverse is the future of the internet. Or it's a video game. Or
        maybe it's a deeply uncomfortable, worse version of Zoom? It's hard to
        say. <br />
        <br /> It's been nearly six months since Facebook announced it was
        rebranding to Meta and would focus its future on the upcoming
        “metaverse.” In the time since, what that term means hasn't gotten any
        clearer. Meta is building a VR social platform, Roblox is facilitating
        user-generated video games, and some companies are offering up little
        more than broken game worlds that happen to have NFTs attached.
        <br />
        <br />
        Advocates from niche startups to tech giants have argued that this lack
        of coherence is because the metaverse is still being built, and it's too
        new to define what it means. The internet existed in the 1970s, for
        example, but not every idea of what that would eventually look like was
        true. <br />
        <br />
        On the other hand, there's a lot of marketing hype (and money) wrapped
        up in selling the idea of “the metaverse.” Facebook, in particular, is
        in an especially vulnerable place after Apple's move to limit ad
        tracking hit the company's bottom line. It's impossible to separate
        Facebook's vision of a future in which everyone has a digital wardrobe
        to swipe through from the fact that Facebook really wants to make money
        selling virtual clothes. But Facebook isn't the only company that stands
        to financially benefit from metaverse hype. <br />
        <br />
        So, with all that in mind …
        <h4 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 leading-none my-10">
          Seriously, What Does “Metaverse” Mean?
        </h4>{" "}
        To help you get a sense of how vague and complex a term “the metaverse”
        can be, here's an exercise: Mentally replace the phrase “the metaverse”
        in a sentence with “cyberspace.” Ninety percent of the time, the meaning
        won't substantially change. That's because the term doesn't really refer
        to any one specific type of technology, but rather a broad (and often
        speculative) shift in how we interact with technology. And it's entirely
        possible that the term itself will eventually become just as antiquated,
        even as the specific technology it once described becomes commonplace.
        <br />
        <br />
        Broadly speaking, the technologies companies refer to when they talk
        about “the metaverse” can include virtual reality—characterized by
        persistent virtual worlds that continue to exist even when you're not
        playing—as well as augmented reality that combines aspects of the
        digital and physical worlds. However, it doesn't require that those
        spaces be exclusively accessed via VR or AR. Virtual worlds—such as
        aspects of Fortnite that can be accessed through PCs, game consoles, and
        even phones—have started referring to themselves as “the metaverse.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Many companies that have hopped on board the metaverse bandwagon also
        envision some sort of new digital economy, where users can create, buy,
        and sell goods. In the more idealistic visions of the metaverse, it's
        interoperable, allowing you to take virtual items like clothes or cars
        from one platform to another, though this is harder than it sounds.
        While some advocates claim new technologies like NFTs can enable
        portable digital assets, this simply isn't true, and bringing items from
        one video game or virtual world to another is an enormously complex task
        that no one company can solve. <br />

        JOE RAY It's difficult to parse what all this means because when you
        hear descriptions like those above, an understandable response is,
        “Wait, doesn't that exist already?” World of Warcraft, for example, is a
        persistent virtual world where players can buy and sell goods. Fortnite
        has virtual experiences like concerts and an exhibit where Rick Sanchez
        can learn about MLK Jr. You can strap on an Oculus headset and be in
        your own personal virtual home. Is that really what “the metaverse”
        means? Just some new kinds of video games? <br />
        <br />
        Well, yes and no. Saying that Fortnite is “the metaverse” would be a bit
        like saying Google is “the internet.” Even if you spend large chunks of
        time in Fortnite, socializing, buying things, learning, and playing
        games, that doesn't necessarily mean it encompasses the entire scope of
        what people and companies mean when they say "the metaverse." Just as
        Google, which builds parts of the internet—from physical data centers to
        security layers—isn't the entire internet. <br />
        <br />
        Tech giants like Microsoft and Meta are working on building tech related
        to interacting with virtual worlds, but they're not the only ones. Many
        other large companies, including Nvidia, Unity, Roblox, and even Snap—as
        well as a variety of smaller companies and startups—are building the
        infrastructure to create better virtual worlds that more closely mimic
        our physical life.
        <br />
        <br /> For example, Epic has acquired a number of companies that help
        create or distribute digital assets, in part to bolster its powerful
        Unreal Engine 5 platform. And while Unreal may be a video game platform,
        it's also being used in the film industry and could make it easier for
        anyone to create virtual experiences. There are tangible and exciting
        developments in the realm of building digital worlds.
        <br />
        <br /> Despite this, the idea of a Ready Player One-like single unified
        place called “the metaverse" is still largely impossible. That is in
        part because such a world requires companies to cooperate in a way that
        simply isn't profitable or desirable—Fortnite doesn't have much
        motivation to give players a portal to jump straight over to World of
        Warcraft, even if it were easy to do so, for example—and partially
        because the raw computing power needed for such a concept could be much
        further away than we think. <br />
        <br />
        This inconvenient fact has given rise to slightly different terminology.
        Now many companies or advocates instead refer to any single game or
        platform as “a metaverse.” By this definition, anything from a VR
        concert app to a video game would count as a “metaverse.” Some take it
        further, calling the collection of various metaverses a “multiverse of
        metaverses.” Or maybe we're living in a “hybrid-verse.” <br />
        <br />
        Or these words can mean anything at all. Coca-Cola launched a “flavor
        born in the metaverse” alongside a Fortnite tie-in mini-game. There are
        no rules. <br />

        this point that most discussions of what the metaverse entails start to
        stall. We have a vague sense of what things currently exist that we
        could kind of call the metaverse if we massage the definition of words
        the right way. And we know which companies are investing in the idea,
        but after months, there's nothing approaching agreement on what it is.
        Meta thinks it will include fake houses you can invite all your friends
        to hang out in. Microsoft seems to think it could involve virtual
        meeting rooms to train new hires or chat with your remote coworkers.
        <br />
        <br /> The pitches for these visions of the future range from optimistic
        to outright fan fiction. At one point during Meta's original
        presentation on the metaverse, the company showed a scenario in which a
        young woman is sitting on her couch scrolling through Instagram when she
        sees a video a friend posted of a concert that's happening halfway
        across the world. The video then cuts to the concert, where the woman
        appears in an Avengers-style hologram. She's able to make eye contact
        with her friend who is physically there, they're both able to hear the
        concert, and they can see floating text hovering above the stage. This
        seems cool, but it's not really advertising a real product, or even a
        possible future one. In fact, it brings us to the biggest problem with
        “the metaverse.”
